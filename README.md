# Cubefield Game Project

Using C# and Unity built a 3D endless runner game, integrating smooth movement mechanics and real-time collision detection, achieving 99% accuracy in object interactions.

Implemented various game mechanics such as player inputs, object collisions, and physics-based interactions, creating an engaging and dynamic user experience.

Implemented game progression elements such as increasing speed and difficulty over time, enhancing the replayability and challenge of the game.
